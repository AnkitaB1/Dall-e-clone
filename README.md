# AI Image Generator

Welcome to the AI Image Generator repository! This web application leverages the power of AI to create stunning and imaginative images using cutting-edge technologies including DALL·E, Chat GPT, and Microsoft Azure services.

## Project Description

The AI Image Generator is designed to showcase the capabilities of AI models for image generation. By utilizing DALL·E, a neural network-based model, and Chat GPT, a natural language processing model, this application allows users to input prompts or utilize suggested prompts to create unique and artistic images. The AI interprets the prompts and generates captivating visuals, blurring the boundaries between human creativity and machine intelligence.
